## Installation

<a name="installation"></a>
Perform a 'git clone' to create a local copy of the repository to your local harddrive. From there, open the repo and be sure to run 'npm i' in order to grab the necessary dependencies such as inquirer. Once those are installed, you are now ready to use the app.

## Usage

<a name="usage"></a>
Open the terminal to your repository. When you are ready, run 'node index.js' to begin running through the command line prompts. Type your answer to each question and press enter when you are satisfied. After completing the final question, you will receive a notice through the command line that the readme was successfully populated. You can find the completed readme in a new file in your repo titled "/read.md".
